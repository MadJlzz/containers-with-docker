# containers-with-docker

This repository contains resources I am using to teach how to user containers with Docker! Slides are available here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mnPvEQnZp-ElopwA2LnwmQzd5mvrYm4v751XvtxwjrQ/edit?usp=sharing

# License

You can copy and use for any purpose any resources found both in these repository or the slides. The only thing I am asking is to keep a link to my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/MadJlzz) as a credit of the original work.
